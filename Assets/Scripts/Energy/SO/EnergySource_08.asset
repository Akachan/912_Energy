  description: "Beyond all science, humanity finds perfect balance: a cat with buttered
    toast strapped to its back. One always lands on its feet, the other always butter-side
    down. In its eternal spin, energy renews itself forever.\nNo combustion, no atoms,
    no panels\u2014only perpetual motion. You have reached the ultimate source of
    infinite power."
